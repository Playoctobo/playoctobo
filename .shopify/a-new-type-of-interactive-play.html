<h4 class="h3">A New Type of Interactive Play</h4>

<p>“Tell me and I forget, show me and I remember, involve me and I understand.”<br>
–Xun Kuang, 3rd Century BC</p>

<p>Modern research echoes ancient wisdom in confirming that an emotionally rich, playful, and self-directed learning experience leads to better results than the classical pedagogy many of us grew up with (and often disliked).</p>

<p>By immersing children in a storytelling world of sights, sounds, physical objects, and interaction, Octobo engages a child’s mind, body, and heart in a full sensorimotor experience.</p>
